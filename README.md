# ENM5310-Final-Project---Mateusz-Jaszczuk
This repository is the Final Project code for the ENM 5310 at the University of Pennsylvania.

Code used in the project was based on the GitHub repository created by Andrej Karpathy as part of tutorial linked by Professor in the example projects for the class -  "Let's build GPT: from scratch, in code, spelled out." Code I used in this project is my version of the example code that I rewrote for the purpose of this project. It is still the same structure and logic as the one explained by the author of the tutorial. 

auto_regressive_transformer file is a Jupyter Notebook that contains all the code that was used for the final project.
Three different input files are added as .txt files - they were used to train models. Results are shown in the project report.
